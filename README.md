## Summary

I have project experience in data engineering and recently worked as a CMF Data Scientist Intern at Logitech, where I developed a system to standardize abrasion testing results. Additionally, during my time as an Engineering Analyst Intern at GoFreight, I assisted in creating customized reports and integrated new data sources into existing cloud-based platforms. These experiences have strengthened my abilities in technical implementation and cross-functional collaboration to deliver data-driven solutions.

## Professional Experience

### CMF Data Scientist Intern @ Logitech
**March 2024 - June 2024**

-  Developed and deployed a computer vision system utilizing OpenCV for standardizing abrasion testing outcomes. This system utilizes feature extraction, image alignment, and contour analysis to assess scores in three primary technician focus domains.
-  Worked closely with a diverse team consisting of 4 CMF engineers and 2 technicians to develop and implement experiments aimed at characterizing keycap conditions across different levels of abrasion.
-  Verified the effectiveness of the automated scoring system through 6 technician surveys, guaranteeing precision in mirroring human assessments, and strategized the implementation on 2 keyboard manufacturing lines.

### Engineering Analyst Intern @ GoFreight
**May 2023 - September 2023**

-  Collaborated with a team of 6 members to create customized reports on Metabase for exclusive clients, with a focus on their detention and demurrage costs utilizing SQL queries within PostgreSQL on an AWS-based data platform.
-  Conducted research and aligned settings between PostgreSQL (data warehouse) and MySQL (frontend) to improve data consistency across the platform's services.
-  Contributed to integrating a new data source from the Mailgun API into existing pipelines to ensure the smooth operation of the AWS-based data lake and warehouse infrastructure.
-  Developed a product metrics dashboard on Looker Studio for business units to monitor user activities based on 5 key criteria.

### Data Scientist @ International Games System
**March 2022 - April 2023**

-  Collaborated with data scientists to analyze user patterns among over 100,000 users and categorize them based on their behaviors using metaheuristic algorithms like NSGA-II and Symbiotic Organisms Search.
-  Achieved 75% accuracy in forecasting user behavior for the following day by combining machine learning and deep learning models, influencing 5 business units.

### Project Manager @ International Games System
**November 2021 - September 2022**

-  Reduced data latency from 20 minutes to 2 minutes through the implementation of an advanced data platform.
-  Broke down the objective into a research plan to assess different streaming services like Kafka Streaming, Spark Structure Streaming, and Flink, with a focus on metrics such as throughputs, latency, and data volume.
-  Supervised a team of 6 engineers in creating a scalable data streaming platform for on-premises and cross-cloud environments (GCP and AWS), and in optimizing configurations across applications, platforms, and specifications.
